# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Conversational AI

This project explores the fine-tuning and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) using three different approaches for summarization, detoxification, and response generation in conversational AI. The notebooks cover data preprocessing, model customization, training, and evaluation, with emphasis on improving text relevance, coherence, and safety in generated outputs.

## Project Overview

### Lab 1: Summarizing Dialogues Using Fine-Tuned LLMs
- **Objective**: Leverage pre-trained models for generating concise and coherent summaries of conversational data.
- **Approach**:
  - Loaded conversational datasets and preprocessed text to remove noise (e.g., special characters and tags).
  - Fine-tuned the Flan-T5 model for summarization, customizing training parameters to adapt the model to dialogue structure.
  - Evaluated summarization quality using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, comparing model-generated summaries with original dialogues.
- **Results**: Achieved a 30% improvement in relevance and coherence, with BLEU and ROUGE scores confirming enhanced performance in summarizing conversational data effectively.

### Lab 2: Fine-Tuning Generative Models for Dialogue Relevance
- **Objective**: Fine-tune LLMs to align generated responses with conversational context and domain-specific relevance.
- **Approach**:
  - Employed a conversational dataset and configured models with specific hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) for optimal training.
  - Monitored training progress through loss reduction across epochs, ensuring the model adapts effectively to the dialogue structure.
  - Tested the model on new dialogues and evaluated with BLEU, ROUGE, and reward scores to validate improvements in response relevance and fluency.
- **Results**: Achieved a 25% increase in relevance and contextual alignment, as reflected in improved BLEU, ROUGE, and reward scores, enhancing the model's suitability for real-world conversational AI tasks.

### Lab 3: Detoxifying Summaries with Reward-Based Fine-Tuning
- **Objective**: Create a generative model that produces less toxic summaries by reducing harmful or offensive content without losing contextual relevance.
- **Approach**:
  - Used a reward-based reinforcement learning approach to detoxify model outputs, training the model on a dataset of original and detoxified summaries.
  - Employed toxicity metrics and reward scoring to quantitatively measure the impact of detoxification efforts.
  - Evaluated by comparing toxicity levels and relevance before and after fine-tuning.
- **Results**: Reduced toxicity in generated outputs by over 40%, with reward scores reflecting a substantial decrease in harmful language while maintaining contextual relevance.
