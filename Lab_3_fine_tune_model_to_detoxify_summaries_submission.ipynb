The agent's behavior is defined by the **policy**. And the goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal, or nearly-optimal, policy that maximizes the **reward function**.\n","\n","In the [previous section](#2.1) the original policy is based on the instruct PEFT model - this is the LLM before detoxification. Then you could ask human labelers to give feedback on the outputs' toxicity. However, it can be expensive to use them for the entire fine-tuning process. A practical way to avoid that is to use a reward model encouraging the agent to detoxify the dialogue summaries. The intuitive approach would be to do some form of sentiment analysis across two classes (`nothate` and `hate`) and give a higher reward if there is higher a chance of getting class `nothate` as an output.\n","\n","For example, we can mention that having human labelers for the entire finetuning process can be expensive.

Then, the model will be fine-tuned with PPO using those reward values.\n","\n","Create the instance of the required model class for the RoBERTa model. You also need to load a tokenizer to test the model.
